                        <h2 class="h4 fw-bolder">The First Effects</h2>
                        <p>There are many effects that a water crisis can have and take a toll on. For example there might have to be women and girls that will end up having to walk kilometres to get just an average amount of water to sustain their families. The reason that women and girls have to get water is because that men and boys will most likely have to go to the markets and get the food as women aren't able to.</p>

                        <h2 class="h4 fw-bolder">Contaminated Water</h2>
                        <p>Not many areas in the world have access to clean water sources. In 90% of Cambodia there is a less than 10mg/L Arsensic Concentration near the Mekong River and Phnomh Penh this means there isn't much ground water to purify. There is also a sanitary problem that is quite common in places like Cambodia that have no access to clean water to do so. There is also aroung 3/4 of the population in Cambodia that has no access to this water.</p>

                        <h2 class="h4 fw-bolder">Mekong River</h2>
                        <p>Did you know that the Mekong River is one of the most polluted rivers in the entire world. The Mekong River runs through: China, Myanmar, Thailand, Lao, Vietnam and Cambodia. This makes it one of longest rivers in the entirety of Asia.</p>

                        <h2 class="h4 fw-bolder">Problems That Occur</h2>
                        <p>Without clean drinking water most of Cambodia's people have to deal with what they have. As for the ecosystem it is still going strong because plants and other plant life don't need clean water to survive in a place like this. It could have an impact on the ecosystem as people might have to bathe in the rivers that might be contaminated.</p>

                        <h2 class="h4 fw-bolder">Possible Solutions</h2>
                        <p>There are many things that we can do to resolve these issues in places like Cambodia that are still in a sort of recovery from the many wars and other things that impacted it. We could help by placing in new pipes that have water purifying properties that can help them get clean water and even build a community centre where they can stay and have clean water to drink and bathe in for the time being at least.</p>

                    <h2 class="h4 fw-bolder">The First Effects</h2>
                    <p>There are many effects that a water crisis can have and take a toll on. For example there might
                        have to be women and girls that will end up having to walk kilometres to get just an average
                        amount of water to sustain their families. The reason that women and girls have to get water is
                        because that men and boys will most likely have to go to the markets and get the food as women
                        aren't able to. If for example this happened to Australia, we would probably be able to cope
                        with it as we are not a developing country like Cambodia. However, this doesn't mean that it
                        can't happen, in 1997 to 2009 which was one of the biggest droughts in Australia the Millenium
                        Drought. So no matter whether or not that country is a developing one anything can happen.</p>

                    <p>Not many areas in the world have access to clean water sources. In 90% of Cambodia there is a
                        high contamination of water near the Mekong River and Phnomh Penh (the capital). There is also a
                        sanitary problem that is quite common in places like Cambodia, because they have no access to
                        clean water to actually get rid of germs without getting them straight back. In terms of the
                        population this means that around 3/4 of the entirety of Cambodia's population is unable to
                        access clean water, while 1/4 has some sort of access to a decently clean source of water.</p>

                    <p>Did you know that the Mekong River is one of the most polluted rivers in the entire world. The
                        Mekong River runs through: China, Myanmar, Thailand, Lao, Vietnam and Cambodia. This makes it
                        one of longest rivers in the entirety of Asia. The river is so polluted but many residents have
                        got to deal with what they have because they know what will happen to the children they are
                        raising.</p>

                    <p>Without clean drinking water most of Cambodia's people have to deal with what they have. As for
                        the ecosystem it is still going strong because plants and other plant life don't need clean
                        water to survive in a place like this. It could have an impact on the ecosystem as people might
                        have to bathe in the rivers that might be contaminated.</p>

                    <p>There are many things that we can do to resolve these issues in places like Cambodia that are
                        still in a sort of recovery from the many wars and other things that impacted it. We could help
                        by placing in new pipes that have water purifying properties that can help them get clean water
                        and even build a community centre where they can stay and have clean water to drink and bathe in
                        for the time being at least. We could also build a dam so then all the rainwater can be caught 
                        and then distributed through the houses</p>

                    <p>Cambodia is home to one of the largest Lakes in Asia and that being the Tonl√© Sap Lake. Being
                        literally the largest lake in South East Asia. However, like most of the things in Cambodia it
                        also highly polluted. People who live next to this water mass have to do with the water it
                        provides.</p>
